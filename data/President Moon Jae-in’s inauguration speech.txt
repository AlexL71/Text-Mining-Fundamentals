Honored and beloved citizens of the Republic of Korea, thank you. I bow my head in deep gratitude for your great choice. Today, as the 19th President of the Republic of Korea, I take my first step toward building a new Korea. At this moment, my shoulders are heavy with the grave sense of duty entrusted to me by the people. My heart burns with passion to create a country we have never experienced before. And my mind is filled with a blueprint for opening a new world of unity and coexistence.

The new Korea that we seek to create is the very nation our forebears consistently pursued, despite countless frustrations and defeats. It is also the country that our young people have long aspired to achieve, enduring many sacrifices and hardships. To build such a Korea, I declare before history and the people that I will carry out my responsibility and mission as the 19th President of the Republic of Korea with humility, though I feel fear as well.

I extend my thanks and heartfelt consolation to the other candidates who ran in this election. In this election, there are no winners or losers. We are partners who must together lead the new Korea. Now, leaving behind the fierce competition, we must join hands and march forward together.

Respected citizens, over the past few months we have gone through an unprecedented period of political upheaval. Politics was in turmoil, but the people were great. Even in the face of the impeachment and arrest of a sitting president, the people opened a new path forward for Korea. Our people did not despair, but instead turned crisis into opportunity, and today they have opened a new world. The greatness of Korea is the greatness of its people. And in this presidential election, our people have created yet another history, choosing a new president with broad and balanced support from across the nation.

From today, I will be the president of all citizens. Even those who did not support me are still my people, our people, whom I will serve. I make a solemn promise: May 10, 2017 will be recorded in history as the day true national unity began.

Beloved citizens,
For the difficult years behind us, the people asked, “Is this really a country?” President Moon Jae-in will begin anew from that very question. From today, I will be the president who makes this nation worthy of its name. I will boldly break with the wrong practices of the old era. The presidency itself will be renewed.

First, I will eliminate the authoritarian culture of the presidency. Once preparations are complete, I will leave the current Blue House and open a new era of the Gwanghwamun presidency. I will sit shoulder to shoulder with my aides and discuss matters directly. I will be a president who communicates frequently with the people. On major issues, I will personally brief the press. On my way home, I will stop by markets and have informal conversations with citizens I meet. At times, I will hold large public debates in Gwanghwamun Square.

I will share presidential power as much as possible. I will make power institutions completely independent from politics. No institution will be allowed to exercise unchecked authority; safeguards will be in place. I will work with humility. I will be a president who sees eye-to-eye with the people. I will swiftly resolve the security crisis. I will work tirelessly for peace on the Korean Peninsula. If necessary, I will fly directly to Washington. I will also visit Beijing and Tokyo, and if conditions permit, Pyongyang as well. I will do everything I can for the settlement of peace on the Korean Peninsula. The Korea–U.S. alliance will be further strengthened. At the same time, I will engage in sincere negotiations with the United States and China to resolve the THAAD issue. Strong security comes from strong defense capabilities. I will strive to strengthen our self-reliant defense and lay the foundation for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. By establishing a structure of peace in Northeast Asia, I will create a turning point for easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

I will also change the politics of division and conflict. The conflict between conservatives and progressives must end. As president, I will take the initiative to engage in direct dialogue. The opposition is a partner in governing the nation. I will institutionalize dialogue and meet with them regularly. I will appoint people evenly from across the country. Merit and suitability will be the guiding principles of appointments. Regardless of whether someone supported me or not, if they are competent, I will seek them out and entrust them with responsibility.

Domestically and abroad, the economy is difficult. People’s livelihoods are difficult. As I promised during the campaign, I will put jobs first above all else. At the same time, I will lead in reforming the chaebol (conglomerates). Under the Moon Jae-in administration, the word “collusion between government and business” will completely disappear. I will work to resolve conflicts between regions, classes, and generations, and also seek solutions to the problem of irregular workers. I will build a society without discrimination.

I repeat once more: under the Moon Jae-in government, opportunities will be equal, the process will be fair, and the outcome will be just.

Respected citizens,
This presidential election was held due to the impeachment of the previous president. The unfortunate history of failed presidents continues. With this election, that unfortunate history must end.

I will set a new model for the presidency of the Republic of Korea. I will do my utmost to become a successful president, as judged by the people and history. In doing so, I will repay the trust and support you have given me. I will be a clean president. I will take office empty-handed and leave office empty-handed. Later, I will return to my hometown as an ordinary citizen, sharing affection with neighbors. I will remain a source of pride for the people.

I will be an honest president who keeps promises. I will carefully see through the promises I made during the campaign. Only when the president takes the initiative in trustworthy politics will true political progress be possible. I will not boast of doing the impossible. I will admit it when I am wrong. I will not cover unfavorable public opinion with lies.

I will be a fair president. I will build a world without privilege and foul play. I will create a society where common sense leads to benefit. I will not turn away from the suffering of neighbors. With a heart that worries about leaving no one neglected, I will always care for the marginalized. I will be a president who wipes away the sorrowful tears of the people.

I will be a communicative president. By being humble power in service of the people, I will make this nation the strongest. I will not be a president who reigns and rules, but one who talks and communicates. As the president of the Gwanghwamun era, I will be close to the people. I will remain a warm president, a president like a friend.
